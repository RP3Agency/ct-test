# Question 6

Using either PHP5, Java or C#, create a class that converts between Centigrade and Fahrenheit

- The class should have getters and setters for each value (implemented appropriately in the language you are using)
- When one value is set, it should update the other value
- Name your class TemperatureConverter and save your code in a file appropriately named for the language you are using
- Add and commit your file
- This question is open book/open internet


## Extra Credit

Create an analogous object in JavaScript that models the same behavior

- Save your code in a file called TemperatureConverter.js
- Add and commit your file
